<h2 class="nobreak" id="ABRAHAM_LINCOLN">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">By President Woodrow Wilson</p>


<p>Address by Woodrow Wilson, President of the United
States, on the occasion of the acceptance by the War
Department of a deed of gift to the Nation by the Lincoln
Farm Association of the Lincoln birthplace farm at
Hodgenville, Ky. Here, over the log cabin where Abraham
Lincoln was born, destined to preserve the Nation
and to free the slave, a grateful people have dedicated
this memorial to unity, peace, and brotherhood among
these States.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>No more significant memorial could have been presented
to the Nation than this. It expresses so much of
what is singular and noteworthy in the history of the
country; it suggests so many of the things that we prize
most highly in our life and in our system of government.
How eloquent this little house within this shrine is of
the vigor of democracy! There is nowhere in the land
any home so remote, so humble, that it may not contain
the power of mind and heart and conscience to which
nations yield and history submits its processes. Nature
pays no tribute to aristocracy, subscribes to no creed
of caste, renders fealty to no monarch or master of any
name or kind. Genius is no snob. It does not run after
titles or seek by preference the high circles of society.
It affects humble company as well as great. It pays no
special tribute to universities or learned societies or
conventional standards of greatness, but serenely chooses
its own comrades, its own haunts, its own cradle even,
and its own life of adventure and of training. Here is
proof of it. This little hut was the cradle of one of
the great sons of men, a man of singular, delightful,
vital genius who presently emerged upon the great
stage of the Nation’s history, gaunt, shy, ungainly, but
dominant and majestic, a natural ruler of men, himself
inevitably the central figure of the great plot. No
man can explain this, but every man can see how it
demonstrates the vigor of democracy, where every door
is open, in every hamlet and countryside, in city and
wilderness alike, for the ruler to emerge when he will
and claim his leadership in the free life. Such are the
authentic proofs of the validity and vitality of democracy.</p>

<p>Here, no less, hides the mystery of democracy. Who
shall guess this secret of nature and providence and a
free polity? Whatever the vigor and vitality of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
stock from which he sprang, its mere vigor and soundness
do not explain where this man got his great heart
that seemed to comprehend all mankind in its catholic
and benignant sympathy, the mind that sat enthroned
behind those brooding, melancholy eyes, whose vision
swept many an horizon which those about him dreamed
not of—that mind that comprehended what he had never
seen, and understood the language of affairs with the
ready ease of one to the manner born—or that nature
which seemed in its varied richness to be the familiar
of men of everyday life. This is the sacred mystery of
democracy, that its richest fruits spring up out of soils
which no man has prepared and in circumstances amidst
which they are the least expected. This is a place alike
of mystery and of reassurance.</p>

<p>It is likely that in a society ordered otherwise than
our own Lincoln could not have found himself or the
path of fame and power upon which he walked serenely
to his death. In this place it is right that we should remind
ourselves of the solid and striking facts upon which
our faith in democracy is founded. Many another man
besides Lincoln has served the Nation in its highest
places of counsel and of action whose origins were as
humble as his. Though the greatest example of the
universal energy, richness, stimulation, and force of
democracy, he is only one example among many. The
permeating and all-pervasive virtue of the freedom which
challenges us in America to make the most of every
gift and power we possess, every page of our history
serves to emphasize and illustrate. Standing here in
this place, it seems almost the whole of the stirring
story.</p>

<p>Here Lincoln had his beginnings. Here the end and
consummation of that great life seems remote and a
bit incredible. And yet there was no break anywhere
between beginning and end, no lack of natural sequence
anywhere. Nothing really incredible happened.
Lincoln was unaffectedly as much at home in the
White House as he was here. Do you share with me
the feeling, I wonder, that he was permanently at home
nowhere? It seems to me that in the case of a man—I
would rather say of a spirit—like Lincoln the question
where he was is of little significance, that it is always
what he was that really arrests our thought and takes
hold of our imagination. It is the spirit always that is
sovereign. Lincoln, like the rest of us, was put through
the discipline of the world—a very rough and exacting
discipline for him, an indispensable discipline for every
man who would know what he is about in the midst of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
the world’s affairs; but his spirit got only its schooling
there. It did not derive its character or its vision from
the experiences which brought it to its full revelation.
The test of every American must always be, not where
he is, but what he is. That, also, is of the essence of
democracy, and is the moral of which this place is
most gravely expressive.</p>

<p>We would like to think of men like Lincoln and
Washington as typical Americans, but no man can be
typical who is so unusual as these great men were. It
was typical of American life that it should produce
such men with supreme indifference as to the manner
in which it produced them, and as readily here in this
hut as amidst the little circle of cultivated gentlemen to
whom Virginia owed so much in leadership and example.
And Lincoln and Washington were typical Americans in
the use they made of their genius. But there will be few
such men at best, and we will not look into the mystery
of how and why they come. We will only keep the door
open for them always, and a hearty welcome—after we
have recognized them.</p>

<p>I have read many biographies of Lincoln; I have
sought out with the greatest interest the many intimate
stories that are told of him, the narratives of nearby
friends, the sketches at close quarters, in which those
who had the privilege of being associated with him have
tried to depict for us the very man himself “in his
habit as he lived”; but I have nowhere found a real intimate
of Lincoln’s. I nowhere get the impression in
any narrative or reminiscence that the writer had in
fact penetrated to the heart of his mystery, or that any
man could penetrate to the heart of it. That brooding
spirit had no real familiars. I get the impression that
it never spoke out in complete self-revelation, and that
it could not reveal itself completely to anyone. It was
a very lonely spirit that looked out from underneath
those shaggy brows and comprehended men without
fully communicating with them, as if, in spite of all its
genial efforts at comradeship, it dwelt apart, saw its
visions of duty where no man looked on. There is a
very holy and very terrible isolation for the conscience
of every man who seeks to read the destiny in affairs
for others as well as for himself, for a nation as well
as for individuals. That privacy no man can intrude
upon. That lonely search of the spirit for the right perhaps
no man can assist. This strange child of the cabin
kept company with invisible things, was born into no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
intimacy but that of its own silently assembling and
deploying thoughts.</p>

<p>I have come here today, not to utter a eulogy on
Lincoln; he stands in need of none, but to endeavor to
interpret the meaning of this gift to the Nation of the
place of his birth and origin. Is not this an altar upon
which we may forever keep alive the vestal fire of democracy
as upon a shrine at which some of the deepest
and most sacred hopes of mankind may from age to age
be rekindled? For these hopes must constantly be
rekindled, and only those who live can rekindle them.
The only stuff that can retain the life-giving heat is the
stuff of living hearts. And the hopes of mankind cannot
be kept alive by words merely, by constitutions and
doctrines of right and codes of liberty. The object of
democracy is to transmute these into the life and action
of society, the self-denial and self-sacrifice of heroic men
and women willing to make their lives an embodiment of
right and service and enlightened purpose. The commands
of democracy are as imperative as its privileges
and opportunities are wide and generous. Its compulsion
is upon us. It will be great and lift a great light
for the guidance of the nations only if we are great and
carry that light high for the guidance of our own feet.
We are not worthy to stand here unless we ourselves be
in deed and in truth real democrats and servants of
mankind, ready to give our very lives for the freedom
and justice and spiritual exaltation of the great Nation
which shelters and nurtures us.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_1">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">By President Theodore Roosevelt</p>


<p>Address delivered by the President of the United
States (1901-1909) at the ceremony of the laying of the
corner stone of the Lincoln Memorial, at his birthplace,
Hodgenville, Ky., Feb. 12, 1909.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We have met here to celebrate the hundredth anniversary
of the birth of one of the two greatest
Americans; of one of the two or three greatest men of
the Nineteenth Century; of one of the greatest men in
the world’s history. This rail-splitter, this boy who
passed his ungainly youth in the dire poverty of the
poorest of the frontier folk, whose rise was by weary
and painful labor, lived to lead his people through the
burning flames of a struggle from which the Nation
emerged, purified as by fire, born anew to a loftier life.
After long years of iron effort, and of failure that came
more often than victory, he at last rose to the leadership
of the Republic, at the moment when that leadership
had become the stupendous world-task of the time.
He grew to know greatness, but never ease. Success
came to him, but never happiness, save that which
springs from doing well a painful and a vital task. Power
was his, but not pleasure. The furrows deepened on
his brow, but his eyes were undimmed by either hate or
fear. His gaunt shoulders were bowed, but his steel
thews never faltered as he bore for a burden the destinies
of his people. His great and tender heart shrank
from giving pain; and the task allotted him was to pour
out like water the life-blood of the young men, and to
feel in his every fiber the sorrow of the women. Disaster
saddened but never dismayed him. As the red
years of war went by they found him ever doing his
duty in the present, ever facing the future with fearless
front, high of heart, and dauntless of soul. Unbroken
by hatred, unshaken by scorn, he worked and
suffered for the people. Triumph was his at the last;
and barely had he tasted it before murder found him,
and the kindly, patient, fearless eyes were closed forever.</p>

<p>As a people we are indeed beyond measure fortunate
in the characters of the two greatest of our public
men, Washington and Lincoln. Widely though they
differed in externals, the Virginia landed gentleman and
the Kentucky backwoodsman, they were alike in essentials,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
they were alike in the great qualities which made
each able to do service to his nation and to all mankind,
such as no other man of his generation could or did
render. Each had lofty ideals, but each in striving to
attain these lofty ideals was guided by the soundest common
sense. Each possessed inflexible courage in adversity,
and a soul wholly unspoiled by prosperity. Each
possessed all the gentler virtues commonly exhibited by
good men who lack rugged strength of character. Each
possessed also all the strong qualities commonly exhibited
by those towering masters of mankind who have
too often shown themselves devoid of so much as the
understanding of the words by which we signify the
qualities of duty, of mercy, of devotion to the right, of
lofty disinterestedness in battling for the good of others.
There have been other men as great and other men as
good; but in all the history of mankind there are no
other two great men as good as these, no other two
good men as great. Widely though the problems of today
differ from the problems set for solution to Washington
when he founded this Nation, to Lincoln when he
saved it and freed the slave, yet the qualities they
showed in meeting these problems are exactly the same
as those we should show in doing our work today.</p>

<p>Lincoln saw into the future with the prophetic imagination
usually vouchsafed only to the poet and the
seer. He had in him all the lift toward greatness of
the visionary, without any of the visionary’s fanaticism
or egotism, without any of the visionary’s narrow jealousy
of the practical man and inability to strive in practical
fashion for the realization of an ideal. He had the
practical man’s hard common sense and willingness to
adapt means to ends; but there was in him none of
that morbid growth of mind and soul which blinds so
many practical men to the higher things of life. No
more practical man ever lived than this homely backwoods
idealist; but he had nothing in common with those
practical men whose consciences are warped until they
fail to distinguish between good and evil, fail to understand
that strength, ability, shrewdness, whether in the
world of business or of politics, only serve to make
their possessor a more noxious, a more evil, member of
the community if they are not guided and controlled by
a fine and high moral sense.</p>

<p>We of this day must try to solve many social and
industrial problems, requiring to an especial degree the
combination of indomitable resolution with cool-headed
sanity. We can profit by the way in which Lincoln used
both these traits as he strove for reform. We can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
learn much of value from the very attacks which following
that course brought upon his head, attacks alike
by the extremists of revolution and by the extremists of
reaction. He never wavered in devotion to his principles,
in his love for the Union, and in his abhorrence
of slavery. Timid and lukewarm people were always
denouncing him because he was too extreme; but
as a matter of fact he never went to extremes, he
worked step by step; and because of this the extremists
hated and denounced him with a fervor which now
seems to us fantastic in its deification of the unreal
and the impossible. At the very time when one side
was holding him up as the apostle of social revolution
because he was against slavery, the leading abolitionist
denounced him as the “slave hound of Illinois.” When
he was the second time candidate for President, the
majority of his opponents attacked him because of what
they termed his extreme radicalism, while a minority
threatened to bolt his nomination because he was not
radical enough. He had continually to check those who
wished to go forward too fast, at the very time that
he overrode the opposition of those who wished not to
go forward at all. The goal was never dim before his
vision; but he picked his way cautiously, without either
halt or hurry, as he strode toward it, through such a
morass of difficulty that no man of less courage would
have attempted it, while it would surely have overwhelmed
any man of judgment less serene. Yet perhaps
the most wonderful thing of all, and, from the standpoint
of the America of today and of the future, the
most vitally important, was the extraordinary way in
which Lincoln could fight valiantly against what he
deemed wrong and yet preserve undiminished his love
and respect for the brother from whom he differed. In
the hour of a triumph that would have turned any
weaker man’s head, in the heat of a struggle which
spurred many a good man to dreadful vindictiveness, he
said truthfully that so long as he had been in his office
he had never willingly planted a thorn in any man’s
bosom, and besought his supporters to study the incidents
of the trial through which they were passing as
philosophy from which to learn wisdom and not as
wrongs to be avenged; ending with the solemn exhortation
that, as the strife was over, all should reunite in
a common effort to save their common country.</p>

<p>He lived in days that were great and terrible, when
brother fought against brother for what each sincerely
deemed to be the right. In a contest so grim the strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
men who alone can carry it through are rarely able to
do justice to the deep convictions of those with whom
they grapple in mortal strife. At such times men see
through a glass darkly; to only the rarest and loftiest
spirits is vouchsafed that clear vision which gradually
comes to all, even to the lesser, as the struggle fades
into distance, and wounds are forgotten, and peace
creeps back to the hearts that were hurt. But to Lincoln
was given this supreme vision. He did not hate
the man from whom he differed. Weakness was as foreign
as wickedness to his strong, gentle nature; but his
courage was of a quality so high that it needed no bolstering
of dark passion. He saw clearly that the same
high qualities, the same courage, and willingness for
self-sacrifice, and devotion to the right as it was given
them to see the right, belonged both to the men of the
North and to the men of the South. As the years roll
by, and as all of us, wherever we dwell, grow to feel an
equal pride in the valor and self-devotion, alike of the
men who wore the blue and the men who wore the gray,
so this whole Nation will grow to feel a peculiar sense
of pride in the mightiest of the mighty men who mastered
the mighty days; the lover of his country and of
all mankind; the man whose blood was shed for the
union of his people and for the freedom of a race,
Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>
<p><b>To the Teacher</b>: These silent reading lessons differ
radically in three particulars from the lessons found in
the usual school reader and hence should be used to supplement
the regular reading lessons rather than to replace
them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. It is the aim of the series to provide material
which is not easily accessible to most elementary school
children, and yet which is of prime importance in extending
their literary, geographical and historical horizons.</p>

<p>2. This series provides for the maximum of self-activity
on the part of the pupil with the minimum of effort on
the part of the teacher. Indeed, these lessons will produce
results in inverse proportion to the activity displayed
by the teacher. Let the pupils have this booklet in their
hands; read it; complete the required work outlined on
the lessons, and conduct the class discussions with as little
interference by the teacher as possible.</p>

<p>3. But the best use that can be made of these lessons
lies in their provision for the superior readers of the class,
who quickly exhaust the possibilities of the <i>regular reading
lesson</i> and who have both the ability and the desire to attempt
advanced work. It may be well to restrict the use
of this material entirely to this advanced group, excusing
the members of the group from a large part of the routine
lessons. Such a procedure will place an incentive before
the indifferent reader to improve his work, that will materially
raise the standard of reading through the entire
class.</p>
</div>

<p><b>To the Pupil</b>: You have all seen a rock thrown into
a quiet pond and noticed how the impact of the rock on
the water sent out little waves of ever increasing size until
they reached the margin of the pond. A good reading
lesson ought to do something of the same sort; it ought
to lead you on to read and think of many things, not only
in the actual reading lesson itself but of persons and
places and events connected with the lesson. A reading
lesson which is read merely for the sake of reading something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
is of little value to pupils of your grade; it should
build up in your thoughts pictures and memories which
will be an inspiration and a delight to you as long as you
live. Most of you have studied Wadsworth’s “Daffodils,”
and will remember how the poet refers to that “inward
eye which is the bliss of solitude.” A fine reading lesson
should do just that; it should stock one’s mind with innumerable
pictures upon which “that inward eye” can
feast at will.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="EXERCISES">EXERCISES</h2>
</div>


<p>1. Note the three points of similarity in these addresses
(1) both have as their subject Abraham Lincoln
(2) both were delivered at Lincoln’s birthplace (3)
both were delivered by Presidents of the United States.</p>

<p>2. Remembering that these addresses were prepared
for listeners rather than for readers, have the best
oral reader in your class read the addresses to you. Be
sure to keep your booklets closed during the reading.</p>

<p>3. Which address do you like best? Read both
through carefully and see if your opinion remains the
same. Can you give reasons for your preference?</p>

<p>4. Notice the forceful contrasts in Roosevelt’s first
paragraph. Fill the following blanks with appropriate
words:</p>

<p>(a) “He grew to know ................. but never
.............”</p>

<p>(b) “............... came to him, but never ............”</p>

<p>(c) “............... was his, but not ............”</p>

<p>(d) “His gaunt shoulders were ............. but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
steel thews never ...............”</p>

<p>(e) “Disaster ............. but never ......... him.”</p>

<p>5. In what ways does Roosevelt say Washington
and Lincoln differed? In what ways were they alike?
(Note that Wilson makes a similar contrast.)</p>

<p>6. Fill the following blanks: “There have been
other men as .......... and other men ...........; but
in all the history of mankind there are no other two
............. men as .............. as these, no other two
men as ...............”</p>

<p>7. What does Roosevelt say was the most wonderful
thing about Lincoln?</p>

<p>8. Memorize “As the years roll by,” etc.</p>

<p>9. Read carefully the first paragraph of Wilson’s
address. Put in your own words his argument based on
the phrase “Every man can see how it demonstrates the
vigor of democracy.”</p>

<p>10. Continuing the same idea, what does Wilson
say is “the sacred mystery of democracy”?</p>

<p>11. Explain the phrase “He walked serenely to his
death.”</p>

<p>12. The paragraph beginning “I have read many
biographies of Lincoln” is very beautiful, and very difficult.
Attempt to put the thought of the paragraph into
your own words, rewriting as many times as you find it
necessary.</p>

<p>13. Notice that both orators point out that the contemplation
of Lincoln’s life leads to better citizenship.
Expand this idea in your own words.</p>
